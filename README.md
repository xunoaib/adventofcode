# üéÑ Advent of Code - Solutions ü¶å

Advent of Code is a festive annual programming event that runs every December.

Each day leading up to Christmas, a new two-part puzzle is released. Solving
each part earns a star, with up to 50 stars available by the end of the event.
It's a fun way to practice coding and sharpen problem solving skills!
